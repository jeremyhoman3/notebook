# GitHub Backlog Management - Common Workflows

## Example 1 - [Microsoft VSCode](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
- 32k commits, 560 contributors
- 4,500 open issues managed through labels and milestones
- No project boards in the repository
- Only Microsoft team members can tag issues and assign them to milestones
- Microsoft team members can lock conversations which limits comments to only approved collaborators

### How backlog is managed
- Feature requests are open to everyone and logged as issues, Microsoft members then tag as "feature-request"
- Tags are used for other types of work: bugs, debt, plan-item
- Users can comment and vote on the feature requests (some requests have 100+ comments)
- Microsoft team also reviews the feature request, asking clarifying questions in the comments if needed.  
- Once a feature-request is approved for the backlog, a microsoft team member adds it to the backlog milestone
- Approved microsoft team members move upcoming work into the On Deck backlog, this is always less than 100 items
- During planning items are moved from on deck into the next milestone

### Milestones
- Backlog: all unplanned work
- On Deck: under consideration for upcoming milestones
- Monthly milestone backlog



## Example 2 - Symfony
- milestones are version numbers, every 6 months
